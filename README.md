# Qbe
This is a minimalistic language, designed to be simple to understand and utilize.
The language has a library named "ExtraKeys" to further aid the programmer without touching any of the pointer things.

### Official Modules
ExtraKeys - ExtraKeys is a library that adds functions and keywords like `for` and `while` to the langugae to further ease the development of some, making Qbe feel like it is "High-Level" when it isnt.


### Data Types
__Do Note:__ A name of an (official) module will be in brackets `()` to indicate in what module that thing can be found.


| `DataType`                | `Handled as` |
|---------------------------|--------------|
| `int` <br>`float` (HLL)   | `bin`        |
| `bool`                    | `bit`        | 
| `string` <br> `char`      | `ascii`      |


### Reference Operators
| Handle    | Description                   |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| `@<reg>`  | Address of the given register |
| `%<reg>`  | Value of the given register   |
